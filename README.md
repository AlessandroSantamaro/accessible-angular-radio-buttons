# Accessible Angular radio with button style

This is a learning project to show you how can be developed a radio buttons with ARIA. In the code there are the comparison between the classic mode (native input type="radio") and the button mode with the support of WAI-ARIA (those buttons work as radios and you can choose only 1 option per time). 

All the code is tested with Karma/Jasmine and accessible, if you don't know what Accessibility is you can check my article: [Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://medium.com/@hazlo8/introduction-to-web-accessibility-e22bad642186?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------)

Note: Take in consideration that when is possible use always the default native elements, you will get for free all the native element behaviour.
